# üß© Cortana-Vision ‚Äî Improvement & Audit Report

This document highlights **areas for improvement, architectural refinements, and functional gaps** within the current Cortana-Vision microservice ecosystem. The goal is to optimize performance, scalability, and OCR reliability while maintaining simplicity and modularity.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Codebase Hygiene & Structure

### ‚úÖ Observations

* Each service is  **cleanly modularized** , with independent Dockerfiles and `pyproject.toml` setups.
* Core logic separation between API, Sampler, Greyscale, OCR, and Search is clear.
* Consistent logging and Redis-based event orchestration are implemented well.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* **Remove `__pycache__` folders** and compiled `.pyc` files from version control.
* Standardize naming and path conventions (`app/utils`, `app/routes`, etc.) across services.
* Add a unified **`core` or `common` module** for shared helpers (e.g., S3 utils, Redis pub/sub, DB session factories).
* Introduce **typed function hints and docstrings** across all major functions for developer readability.
* Create a **top-level Makefile** with common targets (build, lint, run, test).

---

## üß† 2. Documentation & Developer Onboarding

### ‚úÖ Observations

* Each service has a `README.md`, but not all describe build steps or environment variables.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* Generate a unified `docs/` directory containing:
  * Architecture diagram (system + data flow)
  * Service responsibility matrix
  * API reference (FastAPI‚Äôs `/docs` endpoints + Markdown overview)
  * Data model diagrams (SQLite schema visualization)
* Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with linting rules, branch strategy, and commit guidelines.
* Include a **quick-start shell script** (`./scripts/dev.sh`) to spin up local services in sequence.

---

## üßÆ 3. Database & Data Handling

### ‚úÖ Observations

* SQLite is lightweight and effective for local testing.
* Database schema creation logic is consistent across services.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* Introduce **PostgreSQL** for production to handle larger datasets and concurrent writes.
* Add **Alembic migrations** for versioned schema evolution.
* Move shared database models into a `shared-models` package to prevent schema drift.
* Optimize frame-level inserts using **bulk commit** to reduce ORM overhead.

---

## üì¶ 4. Inter-Service Communication

### ‚úÖ Observations

* Redis Pub/Sub is correctly used for job propagation.
* Event names (`make-samples-from-video`, `make-greyscale`, `run-ocr`) are consistent.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* Replace plain-text Redis messages with  **JSON-only payload validation** .
* Add **message retry or dead-letter queue** mechanism for failed jobs.
* Introduce an optional **FastAPI internal gateway** for debugging and job inspection.
* Standardize all event payloads into a shared `EventSchema` (Pydantic model).

---

## üß∞ 5. OCR System (Primary Focus Area)

### ‚úÖ Observations

* Current OCR flow uses Tesseract with English + German (`lang="eng+deu"`).
* Preprocessing includes CLAHE, noise reduction, thresholding, and sharpening.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Improvement Roadmap

#### üîπ 5.1 Scalability

* Current OCR is  **single-threaded per message** ; large datasets will bottleneck.
* Introduce **async job batching** or Celery-based distributed workers.
* Use **Redis streams** or **RQ (Redis Queue)** for reliable background task distribution.

#### üîπ 5.2 Language & Accuracy

* Although it supports German + English, OCR accuracy can be improved by:
  * Adding **custom-trained language data (tessdata_best)** for domain-specific text.
  * Implementing **text segmentation and region detection** (using OpenCV contours or EAST text detector).
  * Adding **Levenshtein correction** or dictionary-based spell check for German outputs.

#### üîπ 5.3 Processing Efficiency

* Implement caching of intermediate grayscale frames to reduce redundant downloads.
* Store OCR results in **compressed JSON or Parquet format** for faster querying.
* Integrate **async I/O S3 client (aioboto3)** for concurrent file operations.

#### üîπ 5.4 Validation Pipeline

* Add post-processing validation: skip blank or unreadable frames.
* Store OCR confidence scores per frame.
* Add an optional `ocr_revalidate.py` utility to re-run low-confidence results.

---

## üîç 6. Search & Indexing Layer

### ‚úÖ Observations

* SQLite FTS5 indexing works well for small datasets.
* Dashboard UI (`/dashboard`, `/search`) is well structured with templates.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* Replace SQLite FTS with **Postgres + pgvector** for scalable search.
* Add **semantic embeddings** later for AI-enhanced text retrieval.
* Introduce **background reindex tasks** when OCR data updates.
* Optimize HTML templates with Tailwind or Bulma for better UX.

---

## üîí 7. Security & Configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendations

* Use `.env.example` templates for environment setup.
* Avoid committing actual `.env` files.
* Add **API key or token-based access** for `/upload` routes.
* Enforce **CORS rules** for frontend integrations.

---

## üß† 8. Observability & Monitoring

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* Add **Prometheus metrics exporter** for job success/failure tracking.
* Introduce structured logging with `loguru` or Python‚Äôs `logging.config`.
* Store logs centrally (Elastic or Loki) for debugging and analytics.

---

## üß© 9. Deployment & CI/CD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Points

* Add a lightweight **GitHub Actions CI** to build & test all services.
* Include Docker layer caching for faster rebuilds.
* Add healthchecks for containers (`curl /health` endpoints).
* Optionally deploy on **Fly.io or Hetzner Cloud** for production testing.
